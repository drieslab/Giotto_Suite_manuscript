## Dataset Setup Scripts

This directory contains scripts to assemble and save some datasets as pre-made
Giotto objects. This allows the following figure generation scripts to be more
streamlined. These generated auxilliary files are stored within the `OUTS` 
folder.

- An extra manual segmentation for the Vizgen MERSCOPE human breast cancer 
dataset is stored within the `EXT_DATA` folder.
